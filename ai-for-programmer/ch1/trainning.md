In deep learning, it's perfectly reasonable (and common) for the number of training iterations (epochs × batches) to be much larger than the number of samples. Here's why:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Epoch**: One full pass through the entire training dataset.
2. **Batch**: A subset of the training data used in one iteration of weight updates.
3. **Iteration**: One weight update using one batch.

### Why epochs > samples is normal:
1. **Batch training**: With `batch_size=4` and 10 samples:
   - Each epoch consists of 3 iterations (10/4 rounded up)
   - 1000 epochs = 1000 × 3 = 3000 total weight updates
   - The model sees each sample approximately 1000 times (but in different combinations)

2. **Learning requires repetition**:
   - Neural networks learn through gradual weight adjustments
   - Complex patterns may require many exposures to the same data
   - Small datasets especially need many epochs

3. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:
   - Each batch update is noisy (only approximates true gradient)
   - Many updates help converge to a good solution

### In your specific case:
- You have a very small dataset (10 samples)
- The model is simple but still needs many passes to learn the threshold pattern
- 1000 epochs is reasonable for such a small dataset
- With larger datasets, you'd typically use fewer epochs

### Potential issues to watch for:
1. **Overfitting**: With so many epochs on small data, monitor validation performance
2. **Early stopping**: Might want to stop training when loss stops improving
3. **Learning rate**: Might need adjustment for such extended training

The code is reasonable for a simple binary classification task like this, where you're teaching the network to output 1 for positive numbers and 0 for negative numbers.
