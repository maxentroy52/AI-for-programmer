A **perceptron** is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks and serves as the fundamental building block of deep learning. It was introduced by **Frank Rosenblatt** in 1957 and is primarily used for binary classification tasks.

### **Key Components of a Perceptron:**
1. **Inputs (x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô):**  
   - Features of the input data (e.g., pixel values in an image, word embeddings in NLP).
2. **Weights (w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô):**  
   - Each input has an associated weight that determines its importance.
3. **Bias (b):**  
   - An additional parameter that allows adjusting the output independently of the inputs.
4. **Weighted Sum (z):**  
   - Computed as:  
     \[
     z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_nx_n + b
     \]
5. **Activation Function (œÉ):**  
   - A step function (for classic perceptron) that outputs:
     \[
     y = 
     \begin{cases} 
     1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - Modern variants use **sigmoid, ReLU, or tanh** for smoother outputs.

### **Mathematical Representation:**
\[
y = \sigma \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b \right)
\]

### **Limitations of a Single Perceptron:**
- Can only learn **linearly separable** functions (e.g., AND, OR, but not XOR).
- Solved by **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)** with hidden layers (deep learning).

### **Perceptron vs. Modern Neural Networks:**
| Feature          | Perceptron               | Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Layers**       | Single layer             | Multiple hidden layers     |
| **Activation**   | Step function            | ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax, etc. |
| **Use Case**     | Binary classification    | Complex tasks (CV, NLP, etc.) |
| **Learning**     | Perceptron Learning Rule | Backpropagation + Optimizers |

### **Training a Perceptron:**
1. Initialize weights randomly.
2. For each input, compute the output.
3. Update weights using the **Perceptron Learning Rule**:
   \[
   w_i = w_i + \alpha (y_{\text{true}} - y_{\text{pred}}) x_i
   \]
   where \(\alpha\) is the learning rate.

### **Example (AND Gate):**
| x‚ÇÅ | x‚ÇÇ | Output (AND) |
|----|----|-------------|
| 0  | 0  | 0           |
| 0  | 1  | 0           |
| 1  | 0  | 0           |
| 1  | 1  | 1           |

A perceptron can learn weights (e.g., \(w_1 = 1, w_2 = 1, b = -1.5\)) to classify correctly.

### **Conclusion:**
- The perceptron is the **simplest neural network**.
- While limited, it inspired **multi-layer networks** and deep learning.
- Modern deep learning extends this idea with **backpropagation, non-linear activations, and complex architectures**.
